# THE BASICS

## What is C++ :confused:

* General Purpose :
	Create all types of programs : games,operating systems, browsers,compilers,embedded systems, all other general purpose software.
* Compiled :
	* Converting code that you understand into code that your computer understands
	 * Building code
	 * Compile-time errors
* Case-sensitive :
	* C++ distinguishes between uppercase abd lowercase letters 
	* myVariable != myvariable 

## Source code , Object code , Compiler 
* 
* 

## First Program :
``` CPP_FILE
#include<iostream>
int main()  // the minimal C++ program 
{
	std::cout<<"Hello,World!\n";  //this will output to the console hello world
}
```

* Curly braces, { }, express grouping in C++. Here, they indicate the start and end of the function body. 
* The double slash, // , begins a comment that extends to the end of the line. A comment is for the human reader; the compiler ignores comments.
* Every C++ program must have exactly one global function named main().
* The int value returned by main(), if any, is the program’s return value to ‘‘the system.’’ If no value is returned, the system will receive a value indicating successful completion.
* The **std ::** specifies that the name cout is to be found in the standard-library namespace
